## General Introduction
This project implements the GraphADT abstract data type. 

The main file provides an implementation of Dijikstra Shortest Path Algorithm. The implemented function are listed below:

- insertVertex
- removeVertex
- insertEdge
- removeEdge
- containsVertex
- containsEdge
- getWeight
- getEdgeCount
- getVertexCount
- isEmpty
- Path
  - compareTo
  - dijikstraShortestPath
  - shortestPath
  - getPathCost

The implementation provides basic implementation of Dijikstra Shortest Path algorithm with several available functions, which could use for further implementation.

Detailed Requirement and all related files can be found in /src folder.
