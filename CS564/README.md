## General Introduction

From School's Enrollment Website, the CS 564's introduction is given below:

*What a database management system is; different data models currently used to structure the logical view of the database: relational, hierarchical, and network. Hands-on experience with relational and network-based database systems. Implementation techniques for database systems. File organization, query processing, concurrency control, rollback and recovery, integrity and consistency, and view implementation.*

The selected project will be the course's final project, which is a simple database management system implementation (GUI provided) of certain dataset (TBD, expected to be finance-related)
