From School's Enrollment Website, the CS 540's introduction is given below:

*Principles of knowledge-based search techniques, automatic deduction, knowledge representation using predicate logic, machine learning, probabilistic reasoning. Applications in tasks such as problem solving, data mining, game playing, natural language understanding, computer vision, speech recognition, and robotics.*

I am still **in progress** of taking this course. Selected Project will be published as the course going through into deeper level.
