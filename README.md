# Sample-Projects
Author: Shi Kaiwen

This repository is for displaying some sample projects/demos I have written in my past CS/ECE classes in UW-Madison. Each sample projects will have separate introductions within their folders. 

All sample projects are stored at separate class folders. Within each class folder there are also a README file that generally introduces other knowledges (e.g. Data Structures, ideas & opinions, etc.) that I have learned in these classes.

Projects are from following courses (up to Fall 2021)
- CS 300 Programming II (Spring 2021)
- ECE 354 Machine Organization & Programming (Summer 2021)
- CS 400 Programming III (Summer 2021)
- CS 540 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2021, In Progress)

The repository is currently updating and many new projects/demos will be added soon.
