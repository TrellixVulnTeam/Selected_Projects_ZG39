This repository is for displaying some sample projects/demos I have written in my past CS/ECE classes in UW-Madison. Each sample projects will have separate introductions within their folders.

Projects are from following courses (up to Fall 2021)
- CS 300 Programming II

- CS 400 Programming III
- CS 540 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 

The repository is currently updating and many new projects/demos will be added soon.
