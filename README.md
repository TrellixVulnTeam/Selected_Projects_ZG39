# Selected Sample Projects

last updated: 2022.9

This repository is for displaying some sample projects/demos I have written in my past CS/ECE classes. Each sample projects will have separate introductions within their folders **Scroll to the very bottom if you don't want to read this detailed clarification**. 

All sample projects are stored at separate class folders. Within each class folder there are also a README file that generally introduces other knowledges (e.g. Data Structures, ideas & opinions, etc.) that I have learned in these classes.

Projects are from following courses:
- CS 300 Programming II (Spring 2021)
- ECE 354 Machine Organization & Programming (Summer 2021)
- CS 400 Programming III (Summer 2021)
- CS 540 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Fall 2021)
- STAT 240 Data Modeling (Spring 2022)
- LIS 500 Code and Power (Spring 2022)
- CS 320 Data Science Programming II (Spring 2022)
- CS 564 Database Management Systems: Design and Implementation (Summer 2022)
- STAT 340 Data Modeling II (Fall 2022)
- CS 537 Introduction to Operating Systems (Fall 2022)
- CS 532* Matrix Methods in Machine Learning (Fall 2022)

**NOTE**: CS 532 undecided if gonna take in Fall 2022 or not.

> ### Update 
#### `Writing_Sample`
The folder contains two academic writing samples. The `001_academic_writing_sample.pdf` is an 8-paged ***Independent Research Paper***, which focuses on analyzing the "996" working phenomenon that has appeared in China since a couple of years ago. The `002_stat_project_report_sample.pdf` is a sample of Statistics analysis project report. It is the printed version of STAT 240 selected project.


The repository is currently updating and many new projects/demos will be added soon.
